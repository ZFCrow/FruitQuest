# FruitQuest
## Introduction 
This game is inspired by the classic raindrop gameplay but with a unique twistâ€”players navigate through falling foods, categorizing them as healthy or unhealthy. Each type of food affects your score and stats differently: healthy foods boost your stats and score, while unhealthy ones might increase your score but lower your stats. "Fruit Quest" is designed not only to entertain but also to encourage balanced eating habits through its engaging gameplay.

## Tech Stack 
The game is developed using the Libgdx framework for Java as it aligns well with the educational focus on object-oriented programming (OOP). Libgdx is robust and comprehensive, providing a wealth of pre-built game development functionalities. This allows us to concentrate on applying OOP principles effectively without getting bogged down by the lower-level details of game programming. By leveraging Libgdx, we can create structured, modular, and maintainable code, demonstrating best practices in OOP. This framework not only supports our goal of focusing on OOP but also simplifies handling of animations and physics making it an ideal choice.
